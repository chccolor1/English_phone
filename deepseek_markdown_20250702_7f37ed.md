## FIRE STARTERS OF THE SKY  
*(int)*

The greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated. — Mahatma Gandhi  

In the hot and dry parts of Australia, wildfires are common. But did you know that some birds help spread these fires? Three types of birds, called “firehawks,” do something very unusual. They pick up burning sticks and drop them in other places to start new fires. This may sound strange, but it is true.  

The firehawks are actually raptors, or birds of prey. They include the Black Kite, the Whistling Kite, and the Brown Falcon. These birds have sharp eyes and fast wings. They eat small animals like lizards, snakes, and insects. When a fire starts, the smoke and flames scare these animals. They run out of their hiding places. This is when the firehawks strike. They fly into the smoke, catch the escaping animals, and enjoy an easy meal.  

But firehawks don’t wait for a fire to come to them. Sometimes, they help the fire grow. People have seen them pick up burning sticks in their beaks or claws. Then, the birds fly away and drop the burning stick in a new place with dry grass. This starts a new fire. The fire spreads, more animals run out, and the birds catch them. It’s a smart hunting trick!  

This strange behavior has been seen by Aboriginal people in Australia for a long time. These people live close to nature and have watched firehawks for many years. They told scientists about the birds’ habits. Now, science is catching up. In 2017, scientists collected over 20 reports of this fire-starting behavior. These reports were from firefighters, land managers, and other people who work outdoors.  

Why do the birds do this? The answer is simple: food. When animals hide in the grass or in the trees, it is hard to catch them. But when fire burns the land, animals run out. The firehawk birds use fire as a tool to find their next meal. It helps them hunt better. This is called “tool use.” In the animal world, tool use is rare. It shows that firehawks are clever birds.  

Fire is usually seen as a danger to animals, but these birds use it in a smart way. Still, this behavior can be dangerous for people and the land. When birds spread fires, they may cause bigger wildfires. These can burn homes, trees, and farms. That is why scientists want to learn more about how and when the birds do this.  

Firehawks are not the only animals that use tools. Other animals, like chimpanzees, sea otters, and even crows, also use objects to help them. But the firehawks are special. They don’t just use a stick. They use fire. This makes them one of the few animals known to use fire in the wild.  

So, next time you hear about a wildfire in Australia, think of the firehawks. These birds are not just flying in the sky. They are hunting with smoke, flame, and fire.
