Airline baggage fees have become part and parcel of modern travel. As of 2025, most U.S. carriers now charge for checked luggage—even Southwest dropped its free-baggage promise in May, introducing fees of around $35 for the first bag and $45 for the second. That’s a real pinch at the checkout. But here’s the good news: choosing the right credit card can be your ace in the hole—helping you breeze past those fees.

### Why Baggage Fees Keep Rising
Airlines rely on baggage fees to boost revenue—especially low-cost carriers, where such fees can make up over 20% of income. Rising fuel and labour costs also push carriers to raise fees even more. So, knowing how to avoid those fees isn’t just smart—it’s almost a necessity.

### Credit Cards: Your Key to Free Checked Bags
There are two main types of credit cards that can help:  
1. **Airline-branded cards with free checked bags** – These cards let you—and sometimes your travel companions—check at least one bag for free when you use the card to buy your ticket. If you travel with the same airline regularly, this can add up to serious savings.  
2. **Flexible travel cards with travel credits** – Some premium travel cards offer annual travel credits (e.g. $200–$300) that offset baggage fees, among other travel costs. These are ideal if you're flexible and use different airlines, or if you value extra perks like lounge access or rental insurance.  

### Which Card Should You Choose?
1. **Know your travel habits**  
   - Fly mostly with one airline? An airline-branded card may be your best bet.  
   - Travel with different airlines? A flexible travel card might serve you better.  
2. **Weigh the annual fee**  
   - Premium cards often cost hundreds per year, but travel credits and other freebies can easily outweigh that.  
3. **Check extra perks**  
   - Many cards offer help with airport lounge access, Global Entry or TSA PreCheck fees, and trip insurance. Consider what you value most.  

### Real Tips from Travelers
One traveler offered a simple but effective tip:  
“To avoid baggage fees limit yourself to carry on. If there is a fee for carry on limit yourself to one personal item.”

Packing light is still one of the simplest ways to dodge fees altogether.

### Making It All Add Up
Let’s say you pay $35 per checked bag. That’s $70 each round-trip—nearly enough to pay for a moderate annual card fee. If your card includes free baggage or travel credits, you can often end up ahead of the game. Pack smart, pick the right card, and you’ll be flying fee-free in no time.
