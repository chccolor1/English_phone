**Every autumn, Korea celebrates Chuseok, often called Korean Thanksgiving. It is one of the country's biggest and most meaningful holidays. Families gather, ancestors are honored, and tables are filled with food that reflects both tradition and the season's harvest. In October 2025, Chuseok continues to connect the past with the present, showing how culture can adapt while keeping its heart intact.**

### The Spirit of Gratitude

At its core, Chuseok is a time of thanksgiving for the harvest. Long ago, when farming was central to Korean life, this festival marked the season when families reaped crops and thanked their ancestors for blessings. Today, even in modern cities like Seoul, the feeling of gratitude remains strong. Families travel long distances to reunite, proving the saying, "blood is thicker than water."

### Traditional Customs

One of the most important customs is *charge*, the ancestral memorial ritual. Families prepare a table with rice, fruits, vegetables, and other foods to honor those who came before them. This practice is not just about remembering is one way Chuseok continues to bridge generations.

Food That Tells a Story

Chuseok food is more than just delicious—it carries meaning. The most famous dish is songpyeon, a half-moon-shaped rice cake filled with sesame, beans, or chestnuts. Families often gather to make songpyeon together, believing that beautifully shaped rice cakes bring good fortune.

Seasonal fruits like pears and apples are also common. In 2025, eco-friendly farming has gained popularity, so many families are choosing organic produce to celebrate the season more sustainably.

Celebrating in the City

While many Koreans return to their hometowns, cities like Seoul also offer ways to enjoy Chuseok. Cultural centers and museums host performances of samulnori (traditional percussion music) and talchum (mask dances). Parks hold folk games such as szireum (Korean wrestling) and tug-of-war, allowing locals and tourists alike to join the fun.

Shopping districts prepare Chuseok gift sets filled with teas, cosmetics, or local delicacies. These modern offerings reflect how traditions can evolve with changing lifestyles. For young Koreans who may not be able to travel, these events provide a chance to celebrate in their own way.

What's New in 2025

This year, Chuseok brings even more exciting experiences. In Seoul, families can visit Namsangol Hanok Village or the Korean Folk Village to make songpyeon, watch tightrope walking, mask dances, and even traditional wrestling. Museums such as the National Folk Museum of Korea have special harvest exhibits and free workshops, giving visitors the chance to make crafts and learn more about Korean culture.

The autumn weather is perfect for outdoor fun. Families can enjoy colorful walks in Seoul Forest, have a picnic at Olympic Park, or take in city views from Namsan Mountain. Along the Han River, evening drone shows light up the sky, offering a modern twist on the holiday mood.

October in Seoul also brings other attractions. The Seoul International Garden Show fills Boramae Park with flowers until mid-month, while the Seoul Outdoor Library stays open for readers who want to enjoy books in the crisp fall air. Street performers also appear during the Seoul Street Arts Festival, turning public spaces into open-air stages.

For those abroad, Chuseok is celebrated in many cities. In Washington, D.C., a family festival features storytelling, crafts, and music. San Francisco's Presidio Park holds a lively event with food, K-Pop, and games. In Tacoma, visitors can join drumming, hanbok dress-up, and traditional dance. These celebrations help bring the spirit of Chuseok to international communities.

A Holiday for Everyone

Chuseok is not only for Koreans. With international communities growing, especially in cities, foreigners are often invited to join in. Schools, universities, and cultural programs host workshops where people can try on hanbok, make songpyeon, or learn traditional dances. This openness helps share Korean culture with the world and creates bonds across cultures.

Looking Ahead

In October 2025, Chuseok stands as both a reminder of Korea's agricultural roots and a reflection of its modern identity. The holiday continues to evolve, shaped by technology, urban life, and global exchange. Yet, its central theme remains unchanged: gratitude, family, and community.

As Korea balances tradition and progress, Chuseok shows that old customs still have a place in new times. Like the full moon that lights the holiday night, Chuseok shines as a symbol of togetherness and hope for the future.
