*The art of communication is the language of leadership.*

Microsoft has officially announced the retirement of Skype, closing the chapter on a long era of digital communication. On May 5th, 2025, Skype will be discontinued, and Microsoft is encouraging users to transition to the free consumer version of Microsoft Teams. This move is designed to streamline Microsoft’s communication tools and improve user experience under a single platform.  

Skype users will have two main options: they can either migrate their data to Microsoft Teams or export their conversation history and contacts before the shutdown. Microsoft has ensured a smooth transition by allowing users to log in to Teams with their existing Skype credentials. This means that chats, group conversations, and contact lists will be automatically transferred without requiring any additional steps from the user.  

Jeff Teper, President of Microsoft 365 collaborative apps and platforms, emphasized that the ball is in the users’ court when it comes to deciding their next steps. “Skype users are in control. They can choose to migrate their data to Teams or export it if they prefer to move on,” he stated in an interview with *The Verge*.  

Users who opt to export their Skype data will be able to save their chat history, photos, and contacts. Additionally, Microsoft has developed a tool to help users view their existing Skype chat history, even if they do not switch to Teams.  

Skype will remain functional until May 5th, providing users with a 60-day period to make their decision. During this time, Microsoft will maintain interoperability between Skype and Teams, ensuring that messages sent between the two platforms continue to be delivered seamlessly.  

However, one major feature will not be carried over to Teams: the ability to call domestic and international phone numbers. According to Amit Fulay, Microsoft’s Vice President of Product, this decision was based on changing communication trends. “Voice over IP (VoIP) and lower mobile data costs have significantly reduced the need for traditional phone number calling,” he explained.  

While existing Skype credits will still be honored, Microsoft is discontinuing the sale of new Skype subscriptions for phone calling. Users who currently have Skype Numbers will need to transfer their numbers to another provider, as this feature will no longer be supported in Teams. The Skype Dial Pad will remain temporarily available in Teams for those with existing credits and subscriptions, but Microsoft has made it clear that it does not plan to introduce consumer calling plans for Teams like it does for business users.  

The decision to retire Skype comes nearly 14 years after Microsoft acquired the platform for $8.5 billion. Over the years, Skype struggled to keep pace with competitors like FaceTime, WhatsApp, and Zoom, which provided more seamless communication experiences. Despite an initial increase in users at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Skype’s growth has remained stagnant, reinforcing Microsoft’s decision to shift its focus entirely to Teams.  

Microsoft initially promised ongoing support for Skype when Teams launched in 2020, but signs of it being phased out became evident in recent years. The company stopped selling Skype phone numbers and credits in December 2023, further hinting at its plan to phase out the platform.  

Teper also confirmed that the transition would not lead to immediate job cuts. The Teams and Skype development teams have already been merged into a single unit, and employees will continue working on new features and AI-powered enhancements for Teams. “This isn’t about cutting jobs,” Teper stated. “It’s about doubling down on making Teams better for users.”  

As Skype’s retirement approaches, Microsoft remains committed to ensuring a smooth transition for users. Whether people choose to embrace Teams or move on to other platforms, the choice remains in their hands, marking a significant shift in Microsoft’s communication strategy for the future.
