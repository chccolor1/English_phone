# CHOOSING A SLOW ISLAND LIFE

The greatest wealth is to live content with little.

French Island sits in Western Port Bay near Melbourne. The island stays far from busy city life. Travel happens by ferry from the mainland. No bridge links the island to nearby towns. This distance shapes daily life for residents and visitors. Quiet space stands as the main reason people choose this place. The same distance also creates limits.

A small group of people lives on French Island all year. Census records show fewer than two hundred residents. Many homes rely on solar panels and rainwater tanks. Power lines and town water do not reach the island. Shops remain few. One general store serves many needs. The store sells food, handles mail, and shares local news. Such a setup asks residents to plan each task with care.

Ferry schedules guide movement. Work trips, school needs, and health visits depend on weather and time. A missed ferry leads to long waits. Cars stay dusty due to unsealed roads. Bicycles serve as a common way to travel. Such travel fits the slow pace of island life. This pace attracts people who value calm days.

Nature plays a central role. Large areas belong to national park land. Wetlands support many bird species. Koalas live across the island after early introduction. High numbers of koalas place pressure on trees. Landcare groups study tree health and animal numbers. Volunteers plant native trees and manage weeds. Conservation work links residents through shared goals.

Wildlife protection shapes rules. Foxes do not live on the island. This absence helps small animals survive. Bandicoots and potoroos grow in number after release programs. Bird watchers and students visit for study trips. Tourism stays limited due to access costs and basic services. Such limits help protect habitats.

History adds depth. Indigenous groups used the island for hunting and fishing before European arrival. Later settlers raised livestock and grew crops. A prison farm once stood on the land. The old site now remains unused. Community groups resist large resort plans. Local voices support small scale growth. Self governance supports this choice.

Life on French Island asks for strong community ties. Neighbors share skills and tools. Committees manage events and services. Older residents wish for younger families. A closed primary school shows the challenge. New residents bring hope for balance. Remote work tools allow some professionals to live away from cities. Internet access supports this shift, though service quality varies.

French Island offers a clear lesson. Distance brings peace and order. Distance also brings limits and effort. People who value nature, planning, and community choose this life. Other people prefer easy access and fast services. The island continues with a steady rhythm shaped by water, land, and choice.
