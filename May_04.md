# Unit 4: DENMARK LISTENS TO INDIGENOUS VOICES
"There is no trust more sacred than the one the world holds with children." — Kofi Annan

In a historic move, Denmark announced in January 2025 that it would no longer require Greenlandic Inuit parents to pass a "parenting competency" test in order to reunite with their children. This policy change comes after years of criticism from human rights advocates and Indigenous groups, who argued that the test unfairly targeted Greenlandic families and reflected deep-rooted biases within the Danish welfare system. The parenting test, designed to assess whether a parent was "fit" to care for a child, was almost never applied to Danish citizens. However, it was often required of Greenlandic Inuit parents seeking to raise their children in Denmark, leading to widespread accusations of discrimination and a growing demand for change.

Greenland is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, and most of its population are Inuit. Many Greenlanders move to Denmark for work, education, or health care. However, when parents wanted to bring their children with them—or reunite after time apart—they were sometimes told they had to pass a test to prove their parenting abilities. This rule created an emotional and legal barrier for families who were simply trying to live together. Critics of the test argued that it was based on stereotypes and harmful assumptions. For example, there was an idea that Greenlandic families were more likely to struggle with addiction or poverty. While these issues exist in some communities, experts pointed out that it was unfair to judge all Greenlandic parents based on such broad generalizations.

Removing the parenting test is a step forward in the fight for equality. It shows that the Danish government is beginning to listen to Indigenous voices and understand the harm that unequal treatment can cause. More importantly, it sends a message that all parents—regardless of their cultural background—deserve respect and support. One of the biggest lessons from this situation is the importance of cultural sensitivity. Parenting styles can vary widely between cultures. In many Indigenous societies, raising children is a shared task involving grandparents, aunts, uncles, and the wider community. This is different from the more individualistic approach seen in many Western countries, where parenting is usually seen as the sole job of the mother and father. If social services and government policies ignore these differences, they risk misunderstanding or misjudging parents who come from different traditions.

Instead of testing and judging parents, governments should focus on helping them. Offering parenting classes, family counseling, and financial support can go a long way in making sure children grow up in safe, loving environments. As the saying goes, "you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar"—meaning that kindness and support are more effective than harsh rules and criticism. The decision to end the parenting test does not solve all problems. Many Greenlandic families still face racism, economic hardship, and lack of representation in Danish institutions. But it is an important first step toward building trust and fairness. It also opens the door to deeper conversations about how to create truly inclusive systems that work for everyone.

At its heart, this story is about barriers—not only legal ones, but also emotional and cultural ones. When governments create policies that ignore the lived experiences of Indigenous people, they build walls instead of bridges. Taking down the parenting test is one way to break those walls and show a commitment to fairness. In the end, every child deserves the chance to be raised by loving parents—and every parent deserves the chance to raise their child without being judged unfairly. It's not just about changing one rule; it's about changing the way we think about support, equality, and family. And for Greenlandic parents in Denmark, it's a long-overdue step toward being seen and treated with the dignity they deserve.
