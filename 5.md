Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.

In August 2025, South Korea approved the creation of the **LG AI Graduate School**—a corporate-run institution authorized to grant master’s degrees in AI. It is the first of its kind in Korea, and possibly worldwide, reflecting the nation’s push to develop top AI talent.

### Background
The move follows the **Special Act on Human Resources Innovation in Advanced Industries** (January 2025), which allows private firms to launch graduate-level programs in AI, semiconductors, biotech, and mobility.

### The LG Model
- First dean: **Dr. Lee Hong-rak (Honglak Lee)**.  
- Faculty: 25 experts from industry and universities.  
- Curriculum: Advanced AI theory + real-world challenges with LG’s data.  
- Strong focus on **Responsible AI** and **Inclusive AI** ethics.  

### Why This Matters
1. **New Education Blueprint** – corporations lead advanced training, linking theory to practice.  
2. **National AI Leadership** – builds Korea’s competitive edge.  
3. **Ethics at the Forefront** – embedding responsibility in AI development.  
4. **Potential Replication** – could inspire other industries worldwide.  

The school officially opens September 30, 2025, with first students starting March 2026. If successful, it may set a global standard for blending corporate, academic, and ethical approaches.
