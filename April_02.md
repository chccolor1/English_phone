Unit 2: UNSEEN LIFE BENEATH THE SURFACE
The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.
— Albert Einstein

Hidden beneath the surface of the Earth, there are tiny living things called microbes. These special microbes can survive in places with no sunlight, little oxygen, and extreme heat. They help shape our planet in amazing ways.

In South Dakota, USA, there is a place called the Sanford Underground Research Facility. It used to be a gold mine called the Homestake Mine. The mine was very deep, stretching more than 1.5 miles underground. Scientists now use this space to study physics and biology. Some researchers go deep inside the mine to study hidden microbes that live in the rock.

These underground microbes can work their magic in amazing ways. Some, like Thiothrix, create white filaments that store sulfur. Others, like Gallionella, produce twisted metal formations. These microbes do not need sunlight to survive. Instead, they use minerals and chemicals from the rocks for energy. Scientists are excited to study them because they may be similar to some of the first living things on Earth.

Microbes living deep underground are different from those on the surface. They grow very slowly, sometimes living for millions of years. They can also survive extreme conditions, such as high heat and strong pressure. Some scientists believe that more than 90% of Earth's microbes may live underground. These microbes help shape the Earth by forming minerals, breaking down rocks, and changing the environment over time.

Scientists first found underground life in the 1600s when they discovered strange creatures in Slovenian caves. By the 20th century, researchers started finding bacteria in deep mines and underground water. At first, people thought these findings were mistakes. But over time, more evidence proved that life exists deep inside the planet. By the 1980s, scientists confirmed that bacteria lived in groundwater and rocks, even miles below the surface.

In the 1990s, a scientist named Thomas Gold suggested that microbes might live much deeper underground than we thought. He believed they could survive up to six miles below the surface. Other scientists later discovered a bacterium called Desulforudis audaxviator in South Africa, which lives in deep underground water. It survives without sunlight by using energy from radioactive rocks.

More discoveries showed that deep microbes are everywhere. In a Canadian mine, researchers found water that had been trapped underground for more than a billion years. This water contained microbes, suggesting that life could exist in deep, isolated places for extremely long periods.

These discoveries have changed how scientists think about life on Earth. Microbes are not just simple creatures; they help shape our planet. They form minerals, create new land, and even influence the climate. Some researchers believe microbes helped create the continents by breaking down rocks and moving minerals.

Understanding these deep-dwelling microbes holds the key to many discoveries. They can help us learn about how life started on Earth and if life might exist on other planets. Some scientists even think that underground life could be the most common form of life in the universe.

Our planet is not just a ball of rock—it is alive in many ways. The tiny microbes living deep inside Earth help keep it active and changing. As scientists continue to explore, they may find even more surprising secrets hidden beneath our feet.
