#### THE MOVING PUZZLE OF EARTH

*The present is the key to the past.*

The idea of plate tectonics is a cornerstone of geology. Scientists discovered in the 1960s that Earth’s crust is made of large pieces called plates. These plates move, grow, and shrink over time. This explains how mountains, volcanoes, and earthquakes form. It also shows how continents move and sometimes come together to create supercontinents.  

However, plate tectonics mainly explains things that happen at the edges of these plates. Some parts of the continents, far from the edges, are still a mystery. These areas often have highlands called plateaux. These plateaux are different from mountains and often have steep cliffs. Scientists have not fully understood how they form—until now.  

Dr. Tom Gernon, a scientist from Southampton University, has a new idea. He thinks plate tectonics can also explain these plateaux. He shared his research at a science meeting in Boston. His team found that these highlands may be created by waves inside the Earth. These waves move through the layer below the crust, called the mantle, when continents split apart. These waves could even be responsible for some small mass extinctions in Earth’s history.  

Dr. Gernon first studied something different: how diamonds reach the Earth’s surface. Diamonds form deep underground under high pressure. They reach the surface through special volcanoes called kimberlite pipes. These volcanoes erupt violently and carry diamonds upwards.  

His team found that when a continent splits, it sends slow-moving waves through the mantle. These waves heat the bottom of the crust. This heat creates gas-filled magma, which erupts through kimberlite pipes and brings diamonds to the surface.  

Later, his team asked another question: What else do these waves do? Their computer models gave them an answer. The waves remove parts of the crust from below, making the land above rise. This creates high plateaux and steep cliffs.  

But these new highlands do not stand the test of time. Wind and rain erode them. This erosion washes materials like phosphorus into the ocean. This is important because phosphorus helps tiny ocean plants, called plankton, grow quickly. When these plankton die, they sink and decay, using up oxygen in the water. If too much oxygen is lost, many sea animals die. This process might explain small mass extinctions that happened in the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.  

Big mass extinctions, like the one that killed the dinosaurs, happened because of huge volcano eruptions or asteroid impacts. But smaller extinctions may have happened because of these waves in the mantle. Dr. Gernon’s research supports this idea.  

His work puts the puzzle pieces together in Earth’s history. It helps scientists understand how plate tectonics shapes not only mountains and earthquakes but also high plateaux and even ocean life. Geology’s big idea is still going strong!
