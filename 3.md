# WORKING IN A HOT WORLD

(int)

Sunshine is delicious, rain is refreshing, wind braces us, snow is exhilarating;  
there is really no such thing as bad weather, only different kinds of good weather.  
— John Ruskin

Today, many workers face a big problem: **too much heat**. Heat can make people sick, tired, or even cause death. Around 2.4 billion people (70% of workers worldwide) feel this heat daily. Every year, millions of injuries and thousands of deaths come from heat at work.

When it gets hotter than 20 °C with humidity, workers slow down by 2–3% per degree. This means more mistakes, fatigue, and risks.

### Who Is Most in Danger?
- Outdoor workers (farmers, builders, gardeners).  
- People near hot machines (stoves, furnaces).  
- Older adults, children, and those with health problems.  

### What Can Help?
- **Warning systems** for extreme heat.  
- **Extra breaks** for water and rest.  
- **Cooler uniforms** and shaded spaces.  
- **Emergency plans** for heat stroke.  

Some countries now mandate paid breaks when heat index passes 32 °C.

### Why It Matters
As climate change worsens, extreme heat is becoming more frequent and dangerous. Without action, the risks will only grow. Cutting fossil fuels is key to addressing the root cause.
