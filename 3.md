The best way to predict the future is to design it.

Have you ever felt lost or unsure about what to do next in life? You are not alone. Many people feel confused when it comes to big decisions like choosing a job, going to school, or finding purpose. But what if you could design your life like a designer creates a product? This is the idea behind Designing Your Life, a method that helps people plan their future step by step. It is simple, creative, and anyone can do it—even if you don’t know where to begin.

### What Is Life Design?
Life design is a way to think about your future using design thinking. Designers solve problems by trying ideas, learning from mistakes, and making improvements. Instead of waiting for the "perfect" path, they create many options and test them. You can use this same idea for your life. Life design helps you explore different choices, try small steps, and discover what makes you happy.

This method became popular after two professors from Stanford University, Bill Burnett and Dave Evans, created a course called “Designing Your Life.” Today, people around the world use their method to find direction, whether they are students, workers, or even retirees.

### Start Where You Are
One key idea of life design is to “start where you are.” This means looking at your current situation without stress or pressure. What are you doing now? What do you enjoy? What do you dislike? You don’t need to have all the answers. The important thing is to begin with honesty. Think of your life like a map—you need to know your location before you can plan your route.

Try writing down how much time you spend on work, play, love, and health. Are you spending too much time working and not enough relaxing? Do you want more time with friends or family? These small reflections can help you understand what you want more—or less—of in your life.

### Imagine Different Futures
Life design is not about having just one dream. It’s about creating different “versions” of your life. What if you followed your passion? What if you tried something new? What if money or time weren’t a problem? By imagining different futures, you open your mind to new possibilities.

This exercise is called “Odyssey Planning.” You can draw or write about three different lives you could live over the next five years. Maybe one life includes becoming a teacher, another has you starting a small café, and a third life involves traveling and working online. Each version helps you see what excites you.

### Try Small First Steps
Once you have ideas, the next step is to test them. You don’t need to make a big change right away. Instead, take small steps. For example, if you want to become a baker, try joining a weekend baking class or talk to someone who works in a bakery. These small actions are called prototypes, just like in design. They help you learn what a job or lifestyle is really like before you make a big move.

As the saying goes, “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” Life design helps you test different baskets before choosing the one that feels right.

### Talk to Others
You don’t have to design your life alone. Talking to people who do what you are interested in can help you learn more. These are called life design interviews. Ask them about their daily life, what they enjoy, and what challenges they face. Most people are happy to share their experiences. Their stories can give you new ideas and help you decide what you want.

Also, share your plans with friends or family. They can support you or even help you find new opportunities. Life design is more fun when you have others to help you along the way.

### Keep Moving Forward
Designing your life is not a one-time task. Life changes, and so can your plans. The important thing is to keep learning and trying. If something doesn’t work, try a new path. What matters is not being perfect but being open. Little by little, you can build a life that feels good and true to you.

So, if you’re feeling stuck, remember: you don’t have to have it all figured out. Start small, stay curious, and take action. Your future is something you can design—one step at a time.
