# TOGETHER UNDER THE AUTUMN MOON

Family is the compass that guides us.  
They are the inspiration to reach great heights,  
and our comfort when we occasionally falter.

Every autumn, Korea celebrates Chuseok, often called Korean Thanksgiving. It is one of the country’s biggest and most meaningful holidays. Families gather, ancestors are honored, and tables are filled with food that reflects both tradition and the season’s harvest. In October 2025, Chuseok continues to connect the past with the present, showing how culture can adapt while keeping its heart intact.

### The Spirit of Gratitude
At its core, Chuseok is a time of thanksgiving for the harvest. Long ago, when farming was central to Korean life, this festival marked the season when families reaped crops and thanked their ancestors for blessings. Today, even in modern cities like Seoul, the feeling of gratitude remains strong. Families travel long distances to reunite, proving the saying, “blood is thicker than water.”

### Traditional Customs
One of the most important customs is **charye**, the ancestral memorial ritual. Families prepare a table with rice, fruits, vegetables, and other foods to honor those who came before them. This practice is not just about remembering—it is one way Chuseok continues to bridge generations.

### Food That Tells a Story
Chuseok food is more than just delicious—it carries meaning. The most famous dish is **songpyeon**, a half-moon-shaped rice cake filled with sesame, beans, or chestnuts. Families often gather to make songpyeon together, believing that beautifully shaped rice cakes bring good fortune.

Seasonal fruits like pears and apples are also common. In 2025, eco-friendly farming has gained popularity, so many families are choosing organic produce to celebrate the season more sustainably.

### Celebrating in the City
While many Koreans return to their hometowns, cities like Seoul also offer ways to enjoy Chuseok. Cultural centers and museums host performances of **samulnori** (traditional percussion music) and **talchum** (mask dances). Parks hold folk games such as **ssireum** (Korean wrestling) and tug-of-war, allowing locals and tourists alike to join the fun.

Shopping districts prepare Chuseok gift sets filled with teas, cosmetics, or local delicacies. These modern offerings reflect how traditions can evolve with changing lifestyles. For young Koreans who may not be able to travel, these events provide a chance to celebrate in their own way.

### What’s New in 2025
This year, Chuseok brings even more exciting experiences. In Seoul, families can visit Namsangol Hanok Village or the Korean Folk Village to make songpyeon, watch tightrope walking, mask dances, and even traditional wrestling. Museums such as the National Folk Museum of Korea have special harvest exhibits and free workshops.

The autumn weather is perfect for outdoor fun—walks in Seoul Forest, picnics at Olympic Park, or evening drone shows along the Han River add a modern twist to the holiday mood.

### A Holiday for Everyone
Chuseok is not only for Koreans. With international communities growing, foreigners are often invited to join in. Schools, universities, and cultural programs host workshops where people can try on **hanbok**, make songpyeon, or learn traditional dances. This openness helps share Korean culture with the world.

### Looking Ahead
In October 2025, Chuseok stands as both a reminder of Korea’s agricultural roots and a reflection of its modern identity. The holiday continues to evolve, shaped by technology, urban life, and global exchange. Yet, its central theme remains unchanged: gratitude, family, and community.
