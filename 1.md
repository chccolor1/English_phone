# MORE THAN JUST A BLOB

The sea, once it casts its spell, holds one in its net of wonder forever.  
— Jacques Cousteau

The ocean sunfish, called Mola mola, is one of the most unusual and largest bony fish in the sea. Found in warm and temperate oceans all over the world, this fish can weigh up to 2,300 kg (about 5,000 pounds) and reach more than 3 metres in length.

People often think sunfish just float on the water like a big silver dollar. But scientists have shown they are surprisingly active. Modern satellite tags reveal that sunfish dive down to about 800 metres and then rise to the surface many times a day. They are not speedy swimmers, but they swim with long dorsal and anal fins in a careful, wavy motion. Their stubby tail, called a clavus, helps them steer.

Sunfish eat many kinds of prey. Old books say they eat mostly jellyfish. But new studies show jellyfish are only about 15% of their diet. They also eat small fish, squid, crustaceans, and other soft animals. Genetic tests of their gut contents confirm this general diet.

A new species, the hoodwinker sunfish (Mola tecta), was first identified in 2017 in New Zealand. Scientists thought it lived only in the Southern Hemisphere. But recent sightings in California and even Alaska show otherwise. The biggest one washed ashore in Oregon in 2024 measured about 2.2 metres and may be the largest ever recorded for that species. This is a classic case of "hiding in plain sight.“

Sunfish often host many parasites on their thick, rough skin. To get relief, they float on their side at the surface and allow small cleaning fish—or even seabirds—to pick them clean. It is like going to a fishy spa! This side-basking may also help warm them after deep, cold-water dives.

Sunfish are vulnerable under the IUCN Red List. Today their numbers are decreasing. The major threat is bycatch: they get tangled in drift gillnets and other fishing gear meant for swordfish or tuna. Plastic pollution is also risky: they may eat plastic bags thinking they are jellyfish and then starve.

Despite these threats, the ocean sunfish is a modern marvel. It produces more eggs than any vertebrate: a female can release up to 300 million eggs at once. A larva starts the size of a tiny grain and can grow up to about 60 million times that weight! This extreme growth is unique in the animal world.

Sunfish may look clumsy, but they are sturdy and curious. They do no harm to humans, and divers sometimes enjoy seeing them pass nearby. However, if a big sunfish leaps out of the water near a small boat, it can cause a bump—literally!

### Why Mola mola matters in 2025
Today, scientists are learning more about Mola mola through citizen science, tagging, and genetic study. The rise in sightings of Mola tecta challenges what we thought we knew about sunfish distribution. Efforts are underway to reduce bycatch and protect ocean habitats.

As summer turns to fall in 2025, we can remind ourselves that the mola is not lazy—it is a deep diver, growth champion, and gentle giant. And no one would accuse it of being small-fry: it truly is a heavyweight in the bony fish world!

So next time you hear someone say, “Looks like a floating blob,” just tell them it’s no couch potato—it’s the mola, swimming its own special way across the wide blue sea.
