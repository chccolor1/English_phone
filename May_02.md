## THE SAME FACE EVERYWHERE  
*(int)*  

*To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.*  

— Ralph Waldo Emerson  

In recent years, social media has changed the way we see beauty. One big example is the “Instagram face.” This is a popular look that many people want to have, especially on Instagram. But what does an Instagram face look like? And why do so many people want it?

The Instagram face is a mix of many features. It often has smooth skin, big lips, high cheekbones, and long eyelashes. Many people also want a small nose and bright, wide eyes. The look is the same in many photos, and people from all over the world try to copy it. This face does not come from one culture. It mixes many styles and looks perfect in pictures.

Some people use makeup to get this look. Others use filters on their phones to change their faces. Some even go to doctors for beauty treatments. These may include lip fillers, nose jobs, or other changes to the face. The goal is to look good on camera, especially on apps like Instagram.

This trend started around the 2010s. At that time, Instagram became a big part of people’s lives. People wanted to look beautiful and perfect in every photo. They followed beauty influencers and copied their style. Over time, many faces started to look the same. Everyone wanted the same glow, the same angles, and the same flawless skin.

Even today, the Instagram face continues to be a goal for many users. Influencers often use beauty apps to edit their photos. Some even create online tutorials showing how to get the look. There are now beauty products made just for achieving the Instagram face, like special highlighters, lip liners, and contour kits. These products make it easier to look picture-perfect with every post.

There is nothing wrong with wanting to look good. But when everyone wants the same face, it can be a problem. People may feel pressure to change how they look, even if they are already beautiful. They may think they are not enough. This can hurt their confidence and self-esteem.

Also, many Instagram photos are not real. Filters can change a face in seconds. But young people may not know this. They may believe that beauty means looking like an Instagram face. This idea is not only false, but also harmful. It can make people feel sad about their natural faces. They may think they must look perfect all the time.

Another issue is that this look can be expensive. Beauty treatments and products cost money. Some people spend a lot just to look like someone they saw online. This can cause stress and money problems, especially for teens and young adults.

As the saying goes, “beauty is in the eye of the beholder.” Everyone is unique, and that is what makes us special. It is okay to enjoy makeup and selfies, but we should not forget who we really are. Our real faces, with all their differences, tell our true stories.

In the end, it is important to ask: do we want to look like someone else, or do we want to be ourselves? Social media will keep changing, but being true to yourself will never go out of style. Real beauty shines from within, and that kind of beauty never fades.
