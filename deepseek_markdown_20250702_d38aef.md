Many people around the world know and love Sesame Street. It is a famous children's show with fun songs, bright colors, and friendly characters like Elmo, Big Bird, and Cookie Monster. Now, Sesame Street will have a new home — on Netflix.  

Netflix is one of the biggest streaming platforms in the world. People use it to watch movies, shows, and cartoons online. Recently, Netflix made a deal with Sesame Workshop, the company behind Sesame Street. This means that Sesame Street will be part of Netflix starting in 2025.  

This deal is very exciting. It will bring many Sesame Street shows and new programs to Netflix. There will be new animated series, learning videos, and even some shows for very young children. It will also have some old episodes of Sesame Street that many parents watched when they were kids.  

For many years, Sesame Street has been on TV channels like PBS and HBO. But now, it is ready for a new adventure. By joining Netflix, Sesame Street can reach more children in many different countries. Kids can watch their favorite characters anytime — morning, afternoon, or evening. The shows will be available in many languages. This helps children from around the world enjoy and understand the stories. It also makes learning fun and easy.  

Sesame Street is not just a cartoon. It is a special program that teaches children many things. Kids learn numbers, letters, colors, and how to be kind. They also learn about different people and cultures. The show helps children feel happy and safe. Over the years, Sesame Street has won many awards. Teachers and parents trust the show because it teaches in a fun and simple way. That is why the move to Netflix is a big deal — now more children can enjoy learning with Elmo and friends.  

With the help of Netflix, Sesame Street can grow and change. There will be new music, stories, and animations. More children will smile and laugh while learning. Some new characters might join the show too! This partnership is like opening a new door. It gives Sesame Street a chance to do more. And for Netflix, it means more fun shows for young children.
