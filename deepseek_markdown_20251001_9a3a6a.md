## TRAINING MINDS FOR RESPONSIBLE AI
(adv)

Education is the most powerful weapon
which you can use to change the world.

— Nelson Mandela

In a move that heralds a paradigm shift in higher education and industry collaboration, South Korea has approved the creation of the LG AI Graduate School—a corporate-run institution authorized to grant master's degrees in artificial intelligence. This landmark development reflects the nation's strategic push to accelerate its technological leadership and nurture high-level AI talent.

The foundation for this milestone was laid in January 2025, when the Special Act on Human Resources Innovation in Advanced Industries came into effect. This legislation allows private firms to launch graduate-level programmes in critical high-tech fields, such as AI, semiconductors, biotechnology, and mobility—breaking away from the traditional university-dominated model.

Approved by the Ministry of Education on August 24, 2025, the LG initiative is the first of its kind in South Korea, and it may even be a global first for corporate-run institutions offering formal graduate degrees. Officially set to open on September 30, the school plans to recruit students in the fall and will hold its inaugural entrance ceremony in March 2026.

At the helm of this new institution is Dr. Lee Hong-rak (also referred to as Honglak Lee), who will serve as its first dean. Currently co-director of the LG AI Research Institute, Dr. Lee brings a strong blend of academic insight and practical AI leadership.

The academic model at LG AI Graduate School is designed to bridge theory and practice. A faculty of 25 experts—drawn from both industry and research universities—will deliver courses that integrate advanced AI theory with real-world applications using industrial data. Students will tackle genuine challenges faced by LG and participate in national-level AI initiatives, ensuring hands-on, problem-solving skills from day one.

Ethical awareness is built into the curriculum too. Courses on Responsible AI and Inclusive AI underscore LG's commitment to a human-centered AI philosophy—recognizing that technology must serve society, not just the bottom line.

By establishing this convergence platform, LG aims to close the gap between industry, research, and education. The vision is to build and gradually refine a complete AI education ecosystem—one that not only elevates the company's innovation capability but also contributes to South Korea's long-term competitiveness in AI—a case where the early bird will truly get the worm.

Why This Matters (and What Lies Ahead)

1. A New Education Blueprint: LG's graduate school signals a transformative approach to advanced training, one where corporations take the lead in producing future specialists equipped with context-aware, applied expertise. It's a shift away from theory-heavy models that often leave graduates unprepared for industry realities.

2. Shoring Up National AI Leadership: With global competition in AI accelerating, South Korea's move through the Special Act—enabling institutions like LG's—demonstrates foresight. By cultivating top-tier talent in strategic domains, the nation is laying the groundwork for sustained technological leadership.

3. Ethics at the Forefront: Including Responsible and Inclusive AI in the core curriculum is no small token gesture. It reflects growing global recognition that AI's benefits must be widely accessible and socially responsible—a nod to steering clear of "dangerous territory."

4. Potential for Replication: If LG's model proves successful, it may inspire other corporations in Korea—and beyond—to follow suit. Whether in biotech, semiconductors, or mobility, corporate-run graduate schools could become a viable route to closing the skills gap in high-tech sectors.

In sum, the launch of the LG AI Graduate School is more than a one-off innovation—it's a trailblazer. By blending rigorous academic structures with industry-specific challenges and ethical awareness, it promises to train a new wave of AI professionals who are not just technically savvy but socially mindful. As we head into autumn 2025, the school's formal start and first student intake in early 2026 will be closely watched—because when education is tailored to the future, everyone stands to gain.
