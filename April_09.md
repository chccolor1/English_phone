South Pole, established in 2006 in Zurich, Switzerland, has positioned itself as a prominent player in the carbon finance consultancy sector. The company’s expertise spans project and technology finance, sustainability risk and opportunity assessments, and the development of environmental commodities, including carbon and renewable energy credits. With a presence in over 30 countries, South Pole has been instrumental in advancing global climate action initiatives.  

One of South Pole’s flagship endeavors was the Kariba REDD+ project in Zimbabwe. Initiated in 2011, this project aimed to conserve approximately 785,000 hectares of forest along the southern shores of Lake Kariba. The initiative sought to provide sustainable livelihood opportunities for local communities while mitigating deforestation and land degradation. The project’s significance was underscored by its scale, positioning it among the largest registered REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) projects globally.  

However, by late 2023, the Kariba project faced intense scrutiny. Investigations revealed that the project’s carbon credit claims might have been significantly overstated. Analyses suggested that the anticipated deforestation rates, which formed the basis for carbon credit calculations, were exaggerated, leading to the issuance of more credits than the project’s actual impact warranted. This discrepancy raised concerns about the project’s integrity and the broader credibility of carbon offset mechanisms.  

In response to these revelations, South Pole terminated its partnership with Carbon Green Investments (CGI), the owner and developer of the Kariba project, in October 2023. The company expressed doubts about the project’s adherence to their stringent standards and emphasized the need for rigorous oversight in carbon offset initiatives. South Pole acknowledged the project’s compliance with established guidelines but voiced disappointment over certain management aspects.  

The Kariba project’s challenges have had ripple effects across the voluntary carbon market. Companies that had invested in Kariba’s carbon credits, including prominent brands like Nestlé, Gucci, and McKinsey, faced potential reputational risks. This situation underscored the necessity for enhanced transparency and robust verification processes within the carbon offset industry.  

In light of these events, South Pole has taken proactive measures to bolster its quality assurance protocols. The company has implemented annual quality control reviews for all projects, encompassing periodic risk assessments and corrective action plans. For REDD+ projects specifically, South Pole has committed to internal baseline monitoring every three years, surpassing the current requirement of every six years. These enhancements reflect South Pole’s dedication to upholding the highest standards in carbon project risk management, quality, and compliance.  

The Kariba REDD+ project’s trajectory offers valuable insights into the complexities of carbon offset initiatives. It highlights the critical importance of accurate baseline assessments, transparent benefit-sharing mechanisms, and continuous monitoring to ensure that such projects deliver genuine environmental and community benefits. As the carbon market continues to evolve, stakeholders must prioritize integrity and accountability to maintain trust and drive meaningful climate action.
