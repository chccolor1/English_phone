## BREAKING FREE FROM ENDLESS SCROLLING
(high int)

Information is the oxygen of the modern age.

— Ronald Reagan

In a world full of news and social media, we often feel lost during emergencies. We scroll through our phones, hoping to see news, help, or hope. Yet, what we mostly find is a mix of tragedy, conspiracy, adverts, and even silly memes. This habit has a name: doomscrolling. But there is a hopeful change.

**Why Doomscrolling Feels Wrong**

During disasters like wildfires, the news feeds on our phones can be overwhelming. A powerful image of a family's old photo floats into view, followed by someone's vacation video or a silly joke.

This jumble can make us feel powerless and anxious. We're both scared and numb. We watch and watch, but learn little that helps us or those in danger.

People on the ground don't need more noise. They need clear, useful information. One Los Angeles resident, a journalist, described it simply: "The user experience of getting information ... was dogshit." That is, they could not get the help they needed from social media.

A Clearer Option: Watch Duty

Enter Watch Duty—a free app designed to help during wildfires. It provides real-time fire maps, evacuation zones, wind direction, and air quality alerts. The app is run by a non-profit and uses volunteers and professionals to check the information.

One co-founder said, "We don't want you to spend time in the app. You get information and get out." This shows how Watch Duty is different. It is built not to gain your attention but to serve your needs.

Why This Matters

In times of disaster, people on the ground need clear and timely information—not distractions. Watch Duty shows that technology can be both simple and powerful. Instead of encouraging us to scroll endlessly, it respects our time and supports our safety.

Moreover, this kind of app points to a new direction for technology. Many social media platforms are driven by metrics—like "time on site"—to keep us engaged for as long as possible. Watch Duty, in contrast, aims for what we might call "time well spent."

A Model for the Future

As extreme weather and disasters become more frequent, we need tools that work for people, not against them. Watch Duty is one example. Its creators believe such tools should be free, public, and not owned for profit.

Their anger at how governments fail to provide reliable information is understandable. But that anger has inspired something useful: a tool that gives people knowledge and agency.

Closing Thoughts

It's easy to feel lost in a sea of posts, headlines, and ads when a crisis hits. But there is a better path. Apps like Watch Duty show how technology can focus on clarity, reliability, and real help.

In the future, we can hope for more tools like this—ones that give us what we need, offer comfort, and strengthen our ability to act. Instead of doomscrolling, we might just become better informed, more prepared, and more hopeful.
