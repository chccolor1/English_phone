**E.R. DOCTORS’ BEST SAFETY ADVICE**

*An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.*  
— Benjamin Franklin  

Emergency room doctors see all kinds of accidents every day. They treat serious injuries, but they also see many that could have been avoided. Dr. Abdullah Pratt, an emergency physician, has learned from experience what not to do. He and other doctors share some simple safety tips to help you stay out of the E.R.  

**1. Avoid Wearing Crocs on Ice**  
Dr. Pratt warns against wearing Crocs in snowy or icy conditions. These shoes do not have good grip or ankle support. He often sees people in the hospital with "Croc-specific injuries" from slipping and falling. If you need to go outside in winter, choose shoes with proper traction to prevent accidents.  

**2. Be Careful When Cutting Food**  
Dr. Adaira Landry says knife injuries are very common in the kitchen. Many happen when people cut avocados or bagels too quickly. Dr. Gregory Sugalski adds that slicing bagels is a frequent cause of hand injuries. The best way to cut food safely is to use a steady cutting board and always cut away from your hand. Never rush when using a sharp knife.  

**3. Stay Away from Trampolines**  
Trampolines may look fun, but they are a major cause of broken bones and head injuries. Dr. Sugalski calls them "a broken-bone factory." A study found that between 2009 and 2018, there were over 800,000 injuries linked to trampolines. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises that only one person should jump at a time. They also recommend using safety padding and avoiding dangerous flips. If you or your children use a trampoline, make sure to follow these safety rules.  

**4. Do Not Pet Strange Dogs**  
Dr. Pratt loves dogs, but he does not pet unfamiliar ones. He has seen many dog bite injuries in the E.R. A dog may look friendly, but you do not know its history or what might scare it. Dr. Sugalski says most dog bites in the U.S. come from pets, not stray dogs. If you see a dog you do not know, it is safer to admire it from a distance.  

**5. Do Not Ignore Sudden Symptoms**  
If you experience severe chest pain, weakness, or trouble moving, go to the emergency room immediately. Dr. Landry stresses that medical costs and waiting times should not stop you from getting help. Heart attack and stroke symptoms need fast treatment. Dr. Michael Silverman also warns against driving yourself to the hospital in such cases. Paramedics have the right equipment and can call ahead to prepare doctors for your arrival, which can save your life.  

**6. Always Wear a Helmet**  
Helmets protect you from serious head injuries. Whether you are biking, riding an e-scooter, or doing extreme sports, wearing a helmet greatly reduces the risk of a severe injury. Dr. Sugalski sees many head injuries and says that people wearing helmets have much better outcomes. If you wear one, you are much more likely to walk away safely from an accident.  

Following these simple tips can help keep you safe and out of the emergency room. It is always better to take small precautions than to deal with a serious injury later. Stay careful, and remember what E.R. doctors have learned from years of experience!
