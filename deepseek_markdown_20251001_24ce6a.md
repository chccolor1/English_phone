In October 2025, Japan stands at the forefront of innovation with the launch of its first osmotic power plant, located in Fukuoka—only the second operational facility of its kind globally. This milestone underscores a growing interest in "blue energy," a renewable source that taps the natural force generated when fresh and salt water mix.

### What Is Osmotic Power?

At its core, osmotic energy, also known as salinity gradient power, harnesses the osmotic pressure created when freshwater and seawater meet across a semipermeable membrane. In practice, this process is executed via Pressure-Retarded Osmosis (PRO): freshwater flows through the membrane into the pressurized saltwater side, increasing pressure and driving a turbine connected to a generator.

The Fukuoka plant exploits this principle using treated wastewater and concentrated desalination brine—a clever synergy that enhances the salinity gradient, yielding stronger osmotic pressure and greater energy potential.

Capacity and Performance

Since starting operations on 5 August 2025, the plant has been generating approximately 880,000 kWh per year, sufficient to meet the average electricity demand of around 220 households, or to assist in powering a desalination facility in the region.

Unlike intermittent renewables such as solar and wind, osmotic power benefits from continuous operation, delivering weather-independent, round-the-clock clean energy.

Technological Challenges and Innovations

Despite its elegant simplicity, osmotic power faces notable obstacles—most importantly, energy losses during water pumping and friction across membranes, which reduce net energy output.

Yet, technological advances are steadily improving the situation. In Denmark's Mariager plant (the world's first osmotic facility, operational since 2023), hollow-fiber forward-osmosis membranes developed by Toyobo have enhanced performance. Additionally, nanomaterial-based membranes, such as thin-film nanocomposites, show promise in boosting flux and energy yield for PRO systems.

By leveraging concentrated brine from desalination, Japan's Fukuoka plant also increases the salinity differential—and by extension, the osmotic pressure driving energy generation.

Global Outlook and Future Applications

Japan's success demonstrates that osmotic energy can be scaled beyond laboratory experiments into practical, real-world use, setting a template for other nations. Pilot and prototype projects exist in Norway, South Korea, Spain, Qatar, and even Australia, where universities like UTS in Sydney have explored osmotic systems using local resources such as salt lakes.

Among experts, there's growing enthusiasm. Professor Sandra Kentish from the University of Melbourne and Dr Ali Altaee of UTS regard the Fukuoka plant as a key milestone that may catalyze broader adoption worldwide.

More ambitious estimates suggest that, if technology matures and scales more widely, osmotic energy could contribute significantly—perhaps even 15 % of global electricity demand by 2050.

Looking Ahead: The Promise of Blue Energy

Reflecting on the Fukuoka facility's launch, it's clear that osmotic power is becoming more than a scientific curiosity—it's a viable, resilient renewable energy source, offering continuous, carbon-free electricity perfectly suited to coastal and desalination infrastructure.

For October 2025 and beyond, the path forward lies in reducing operational losses, further refining membrane efficiency, and integrating osmotic systems with existing water treatment and desalination facilities. If these advances continue, blue energy could emerge as a strategic complement to solar and wind, amplifying global efforts toward a resilient, low-carbon future.
