# APRIL BRINGS SUNSHINE AND SURPRISES

**April prepares her green traffic light and the world thinks Go.**  
— *Christopher Morley*

## The Meaning of April  
April is the fourth month in the Gregorian calendar. It has 30 days and comes after March. In the Northern Hemisphere, April is a spring month, while in the Southern Hemisphere, it is a fall month. People enjoy warmer days in the north and cooler weather in the south as the seasons turn a new leaf.

The name April comes from the Latin word *Aprilis*. The exact meaning is not clear, but some historians believe it comes from *aperire*, which means "to open." This makes sense because many flowers and trees begin to bloom in April, shaking off the cold of winter. Another possible origin is the word *apricus*, meaning "sunny."

Some also think April is named after Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and beauty. The Etruscans, an ancient Italian civilization, called her "Apru." The Romans, who took many ideas from the Etruscans, may have named April after her.

## April Fool’s Day  
April 1 is known as April Fool’s Day. On this day, people play tricks and jokes on each other, often catching them off guard.

Different countries have different traditions. In France, for example, the tricked person is called a *poisson d’avril*, or "April fish."

The origin of April Fool’s Day is not clear, but many think it started in Europe. April is a time of change when winter ends, and spring begins. In the past, people celebrated this time with festivals and jokes, making fun of each other to lighten the mood.
