#### EARTH DODGES ANOTHER COSMIC BULLET

A potentially hazardous asteroid, 2024 YR4, which was recently on the radar as the most significant impact risk on record, now has an almost negligible chance of colliding with Earth in 2032. According to NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), the risk has now been reassessed to near zero.  

Initially, calculations estimated that 2024 YR4 had a 0.0017% chance of hitting Earth, while the ESA projected a similar probability of 0.002%. This equates to a 1 in 59,000 chance of impact, meaning there is a 99.9983% likelihood that the asteroid will pass safely by Earth in seven years. NASA’s latest models also indicated that while there was initially a slight possibility—1.7%—of the asteroid striking the Moon, even that risk is now considered negligible.  

“When first detected, asteroid 2024 YR4 appeared to have a minuscule but noteworthy chance of impacting Earth in 2032,” NASA shared in a statement. “However, as additional observations were gathered and analyzed by the Minor Planet Center and NASA’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies, the asteroid’s trajectory became clearer, confirming that there is no significant risk for at least the next century.” The refined models further confirmed that the possible locations 2024 YR4 could be on December 22, 2032, indicate that Earth is out of the woods when it comes to any potential impact.  

Over the weekend, the asteroid’s ranking on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale dropped to 0 out of 10. The scale is used to categorize potential collisions of space objects with Earth. A ranking of 0 means the likelihood of impact is either nonexistent or so minimal that it can be effectively disregarded. This also applies to smaller space objects, such as meteors and fragments that typically burn up in Earth’s atmosphere without causing damage.  

**A Rapidly Changing Risk Assessment**  
Discovered on December 27, 2024, 2024 YR4 measures between 40 and 90 meters (131 to 295 feet) across, roughly the size of a large building. If it had impacted Earth, it could have caused significant local destruction. However, diligent follow-up observations by astronomers worldwide helped refine its orbital path and quickly eliminate the perceived threat.  

Richard Binzel, the inventor of the Torino Scale and a professor of planetary sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, gave credit to the rapid risk reevaluation. “It’s incredible how quickly we were able to reduce the probability numbers,” Binzel said. “Leaving such uncertainties hanging for too long can cause unnecessary concern, but as we refine our data, we eventually confirm either a risk of impact or, in this case, complete safety.”  

**Comparisons to Apophis**  
In the early days of its discovery, 2024 YR4 was considered even riskier than the infamous asteroid Apophis, which caused alarm when first observed in 2004. At its peak, 2024 YR4 reached a 3 on the Torino Scale, surpassing Apophis’s initial risk assessment. However, just like Apophis, new data quickly downgraded the asteroid’s threat level to 0.  

Astronomers rely heavily on continuous observations to refine asteroid trajectories. Key observatories involved in tracking 2024 YR4 include the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, the Subaru Telescope, and the Haleakala-Faulkes Telescope North in Hawaii, as well as facilities in New Mexico, Chile, Arizona, and the Canary Islands.  

The James Webb Space Telescope is expected to conduct further studies in March to provide additional insights into the asteroid’s orbit and size.  

The swift reclassification of 2024 YR4 underscores the importance of continued astronomical monitoring, ensuring that potential threats are identified, analyzed, and either mitigated or dismissed in a timely manner.
