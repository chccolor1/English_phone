## LEADING WITH BOLD IDEAS
(high int)

In the middle of every difficulty lies opportunity.

— Albert Einstein

In today's world, leaders face constant uncertainty. Whether from economic shifts, global crises, or rapid innovation, change is fast and unpredictable. Traditional change-management methods like building alliances, launching pilots, or aiming for "small wins" often work in calm times. But during turbulent periods, these cautious steps can miss big opportunities.

Recent studies in healthcare during the Covid-19 crisis show a new way forward. Leaders who succeeded did three key things:

1. Choose a ready idea and present it as both a quick fix and a long-term benefit.
2. Move fast when people are open to change.
3. Think bigger about what is possible.

Let's look at each step and how you can apply it.

1. Pick a shovel-ready idea—and reframe it: A shovel-ready idea is an idea that can be put into action right away. It may not be perfect, but it works. The trick is to show that it solves a current problem and supports future goals. That double benefit makes the change more attractive to people who must accept it now—or later.

For example, suppose a company wants to improve customer response times. A simple idea may be to use a chatbot to answer basic questions immediately. Leaders can explain that the chatbot reduces delays today and gathers data that can later improve the entire customer service experience. That reframed idea makes it both urgent and strategic.

2. Act quickly when people are ready:
Uncertainty can create a window of opportunity—a time when people accept change more easily. In times of stress or confusion, people look for guidance. Leaders who act promptly can take advantage of this openness.

For instance, during a supply chain disruption, if a leader proposes a new, faster supplier and moves decisively, the team is more likely to support the switch. Fast action shows confidence and gives people a clear path forward.

3. Think big—expand what's possible:
When times are unsettled, realistic thinking often narrows. But those who stretch their imagination can uncover surprising solutions. Looking beyond the usual options helps organizations not just to survive but to transform.

Imagine a school facing disruptions in physical classes. Instead of only planning hybrid lessons, a bold leader might explore partnerships with local community centers to create small learning hubs. That broader thinking opens new paths for learning—now and in the future.

Why this matters in 2025

By October 2025, the pace of change remains high. Advances in technology—such as AI, hybrid work, and digital communication—continue to reshape how we work and live. At the same time, global uncertainty—from climate, politics, and markets—still affects daily decisions. To lead well today, we must move fast, think wider, and stay both pragmatic and visionary.

Here are a few steps to put this into practice:

- Find ideas that work now and support what comes next.
- Act quickly when people are open to change—but not recklessly.
- Expand your view of what's possible—don't limit yourself.
- Use simple explanations that make everyone see both the now and the next.

For example, a small business might introduce a contactless pickup system to meet customer demand now—but also use the data from that system to plan future online services. Or a nonprofit may record virtual training today—while thinking about building a permanent digital learning library later.

Final thoughts

When uncertainty is the norm, traditional, cautious change may not be enough. Leaders who succeed in 2025—and beyond—are the ones who can act quickly, reframe ideas, and think expansively. By choosing ready solutions, seizing receptive moments, and stretching ambitions, they help their teams not only adapt but also rise and lead in change.
