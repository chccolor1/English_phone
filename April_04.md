*The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is now.*

In the relentless pursuit of sustainable solutions to urban air pollution, Serbian scientists have unveiled an innovative creation: the "Liquid Tree," also known as LIQUID3. This pioneering urban photobioreactor employs microalgae to absorb carbon dioxide (CO₂) and release oxygen, offering a novel approach to enhancing air quality in densely populated cities where traditional tree planting is impractical.  

**Urban Air Pollution: A Pressing Concern**  
Urban areas are significant contributors to global CO₂ emissions, accounting for approximately 75% of the total, with transportation and the heating and cooling of buildings being primary sources. In Serbia, about 59% of the population resides in urban settings, a figure that continues to rise. This urban concentration exacerbates air pollution challenges, particularly in cities like Belgrade, which contend with limited space for green initiatives.  

**LIQUID3: Harnessing Microalgae for Cleaner Air**  
Developed by Dr. Ivan Spasojević and his team at the Institute for Multidisciplinary Research, University of Belgrade, LIQUID3 represents Serbia's first urban photobioreactor. The system comprises a 600-liter tank filled with water and microalgae that perform photosynthesis, thereby sequestering CO₂ and generating oxygen. Notably, these microalgae can replace the function of two mature trees or 200 square meters of lawn, operating with an efficiency 10 to 50 times greater than that of traditional trees.  

The photobioreactor is designed to be multifunctional, serving as a bench equipped with mobile phone chargers and illuminated by solar-powered lights at night. This thoughtful integration of utility and sustainability exemplifies innovative urban design.  

**Addressing Serbia's Air Quality Challenges**  
Serbia has grappled with significant air pollution issues, with reports indicating that air pollution was the seventh leading cause of death in the country, resulting in approximately 12,700 fatalities. Major contributors to particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution include energy production, residential combustion, agriculture, windblown dust, anthropogenic dust, and industrial activities.  

Belgrade, in particular, has faced severe pollution challenges, often ranking among the most polluted cities in the region. Factors such as the use of outdated coal plants, old vehicles, and economic constraints have exacerbated the situation, leading to significant health impacts and hindering progress toward European Union membership, which requires stricter emissions standards.  

**Global Implications and Future Prospects**  
The introduction of LIQUID3 has garnered international attention as a potential model for other urban areas facing similar environmental challenges. By providing a viable alternative to traditional tree planting in spaces where it is not feasible, this innovation offers a practical solution to urban air pollution. The project’s recognition by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as an innovative solution for climate-smart urban development underscores its potential impact.  

As urban populations continue to grow, the demand for sustainable and efficient air purification methods becomes increasingly critical. Innovations like LIQUID3 not only address environmental concerns but also enhance the quality of life for city dwellers by integrating green technologies into urban infrastructure. The success of such projects could pave the way for broader adoption of similar technologies worldwide, contributing to global efforts in combating air pollution and mitigating climate change.  

In conclusion, Serbia’s LIQUID3 exemplifies how scientific ingenuity can lead to practical solutions for pressing environmental issues. By leveraging the natural capabilities of microalgae, this liquid tree offers a scalable and efficient approach to improving air quality in urban environments, setting a precedent for future innovations in sustainable city planning.
