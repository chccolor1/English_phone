#### THE POWER OF PSYCHIATRIC LABELS

*The beginning of wisdom is to call things by their proper name.*  
— Proverb  

Naming something is a powerful act; after all, a name carries weight and can shape perceptions. It helps us understand and control the world around us. In science, naming is important for classifying things like animals, plants, and diseases. Psychiatry also follows this approach, using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) to define mental health conditions. This manual, created by the American Psychiatric Association, has been updated over time. It influences how doctors diagnose and treat mental illnesses, as well as how society understands them.  

However, in recent years, many experts have questioned whether psychiatric disorders fit into clear categories. Mental illnesses often overlap, and research has shown that no specific genes or brain scans can perfectly define conditions like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or depression. Critics argue that the DSM’s system is outdated and does not reflect the complexity of human psychology.  

**The Power of Labels**  
Despite these issues, psychiatric diagnoses remain important to many people. Getting a diagnosis can bring relief, helping individuals understand themselves and find support. Paige Layle, an autism advocate, describes how learning she had autism helped her make sense of her struggles. Before her diagnosis, she felt lost and misunderstood. Afterward, she finally had a reason for her experiences. She even became a social media influencer, educating millions about autism.  

Labels can shape identities in other ways too, as they often cut both ways—offering validation but also limiting how people view themselves. Patric Gagne, the author of *Sociopath: A Memoir*, realized she was different at a young age. She struggled with emotions like guilt and empathy. When she learned about sociopathy in college, it gave her a framework to understand herself. However, the term “sociopath” is no longer an official diagnosis in the DSM. Instead, “antisocial personality disorder” is used, but Gagne feels this does not fully describe her experiences. She even suggests a new term, “sociopathic spectrum disorder,” to capture her condition.  

Similarly, Alexander Kriss, a psychologist and author of *Borderline: The Biography of a Personality Disorder*, explores how Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) has evolved. He argues that the DSM has shaped how people see mental health, sometimes oversimplifying complex conditions. Online communities, like those on Reddit, reinforce these labels, making them a part of people’s identities.  

**A New Way to Classify Mental Health**  
Given the problems with current psychiatric labels, some experts are developing a new system. The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HITOP) is an approach that groups mental illnesses based on symptoms rather than strict categories. Instead of saying someone has a single disorder, HITOP sees mental health on a spectrum. Supporters believe this method is more accurate and reflects the latest research in genetics and neuroscience.  

However, changing how we diagnose mental illnesses is not easy. Many people strongly identify with their diagnoses, and a new system could disrupt their understanding of themselves. When the DSM-5 removed "Asperger's syndrome" and merged it into "autism spectrum disorder," many people were upset. They had built their identity around being "Aspies," and losing that label felt like losing a part of themselves.  

**The Future of Psychiatric Labels**  
Mental health labels are not just scientific terms; they shape how people see themselves and interact with the world. While the DSM may not be perfect, its labels provide a sense of identity and belonging for many. Any new system, like HITOP, must consider these social and personal factors.  

Ultimately, psychiatric labels will continue to evolve and stand the test of time, just like our understanding of mental health. But one thing is clear: the way we name mental illnesses affects not only treatment but also how people define themselves.
