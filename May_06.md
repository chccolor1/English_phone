Unit 6: ARE WE DATING OR DOWNLOADING
The more you know about someone, the less you need to guess.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has become part of our everyday lives—from online shopping to music playlists, and now, even dating. As AI tools become smarter and more accessible, some people are using them in surprising new ways—including trying to learn about their date before the first hello. But is it right to use AI to build a psychological profile of someone you just met?

A psychological profile is a summary of a person's personality, habits, and emotions. Some advanced AI programs can now read public social media posts or text messages and make guesses about a person's likes, values, or mental state. For people navigating the tricky world of dating, this might seem helpful. But for others, it crosses a personal line. Let's say you go on a date, and your date already seems to know a lot about you—your favorite books, the way you think, even the kind of jokes you like. You never told them any of this. Instead, they used AI to figure it out beforehand. While their goal might be to make a good impression, the method raises serious questions about trust and consent.

The core issue is privacy. People expect to be in control of how they share personal information. When AI tools are used without someone's knowledge, it can feel invasive—like someone reading your diary without asking. Even if the information came from public online posts, using AI to analyze and judge someone's personality can feel like jumping the gun. Some argue that AI simply offers new ways to understand human behavior. In a fast-paced world, using technology to speed up the "getting to know you" phase may seem efficient. For people who are shy or nervous, AI might help break the ice or avoid awkward conversations.

But dating is not just about data; it's about connection. Relationships grow through shared experiences, honest talks, and learning about each other over time. If someone uses AI to skip that natural process, it could feel like cheating—or worse, manipulating. As AI becomes more common, we'll need new rules for how to use it respectfully in personal relationships. Transparency is key. If someone uses AI to prepare for a date, they should say so. Keeping it a secret breaks trust, which is hard to rebuild once it's lost.

At the end of the day, dating is still about being human. There's no shortcut to building trust, and no algorithm can replace a real conversation. AI can be helpful, but it shouldn't take the wheel. In love, as in life, honesty is the best policy. And when it comes to using AI in personal relationships, the golden rule still applies: treat others the way you want to be treated.
