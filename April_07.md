#### THE INVISIBLE CITY UNDER OUR FEET

*The past is never dead. It’s not even past.*  
— William Faulkner  

In the heart of Siena, Italy, an 800-year-old cathedral stands as a testament to the city’s rich history. While many see it as a permanent fixture, archaeologist Stefano Campana refers to it as “the church that is visible now,” hinting at the layers of history concealed beneath its surface.  

Campana, a 53-year-old archaeologist at the University of Siena, has extensive experience in excavations. However, his approach to archaeology extends beyond traditional digging. He employs advanced technologies, such as ground-penetrating radar (GPR), to explore what lies beneath without disturbing the soil. GPR transmits high-frequency waves into the ground, detecting anomalies that may indicate subsurface structures.  

In early 2020, during the COVID-19 lockdowns, Italian tourist sites were devoid of visitors. Seizing this unique opportunity, Campana and his team managed to cut through the red tape and obtain permission to survey the interior of Siena’s cathedral. Using instruments initially designed for studying glaciers and oil fields, they scanned the marble floors and intricate mosaics, searching for hidden walls and foundations. Without the usual crowds, they discovered evidence of earlier structures, possibly including a church built nearly 1,200 years ago, revealed through the radar data.  

Inspired by their findings during the lockdown, Campana and his collaborators mulled over the broader potential of this technology. GPR waves travel at a fraction of the speed of light, allowing for rapid data collection. With these tools, archaeology is no longer confined to stationary digs; surveyors can now capture accurate images of what lies beneath, even while moving at highway speeds. This breakthrough sparked an idea in Campana’s mind: “Why not scan everything? Why not scan all the squares, all the roads, all the courtyards in Siena?”  

This vision gave birth to the Sotto Siena (Under Siena) initiative, abbreviated as SoS. The project’s goal is to create a comprehensive archaeological record of Siena before more of its deep history is lost to modern development. Unlike protected landmarks like the cathedral, everyday sites are vulnerable to construction and urbanization. Campana refers to these as “emphyscapes,” areas wrongly deemed insignificant to human history. By scanning these spaces, SoS aims to uncover and preserve the narratives they hold.  

The capabilities of modern surveying tools have inspired archaeologists like Campana to dream bigger. If mapping all of Siena seems ambitious, there are others in Europe with even grander plans. Immo Trinks, a geophysicist at the University of Vienna, proposes the establishment of an International Subsurface Exploration Agency (ISEA). Modeled after organizations like NASA, this EU-funded agency would focus on mapping and preserving archaeological sites before they are lost to development, natural decay, climate change, or conflict.  

Trinks envisions a future where entire landscapes can be mapped in days using advanced technologies, with data processed in near real-time. This approach could lead to a comprehensive map of all archaeological sites worldwide. He emphasizes the urgency of this endeavor, warning that without action, future generations may question why more wasn’t done to document these sites before they vanished.  

The integration of geophysical tools like GPR into archaeology is not without challenges. Interpreting the vast amounts of data collected requires expertise to distinguish between actual structures and natural formations. Critics warn that diving headfirst into large-scale data collection could drown out interpretive rigor, making it essential to pair these surveys with targeted excavations to validate findings.  

Despite these challenges, the potential benefits are immense. Geophysical methods allow archaeologists to explore sites non-invasively, preserving them for future generations. They also democratize our understanding of history, uncovering the lives of everyday people, not just the elite. As these technologies become more widespread, they promise to revolutionize our understanding of the past, ensuring that even the most ephemeral traces of human existence are recorded before they disappear.
