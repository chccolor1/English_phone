## WATER UNDER QUESTION
(int)

Pure water is the world's first and foremost medicine.

— Slovakian Proverb

Some people buy water that says it is natural mineral water. They want real water from nature. But in 2025, many bottles of Evian in France were not all natural.

What Happened to Evian Water?

Evian is a famous brand. It says its water comes from the French Alps. Evian bottles say, "natural mineral water." This means no cleaning or changes, just water from nature. But in August 2025, news showed that about 30% of Evian water was actually cleaned in a wrong way.

Why is That a Problem?

In Europe, rules say "natural mineral water" must not change. You cannot clean it or add anything. Real natural mineral water is only bottled as it is. Evian used UV cleaning and charcoal filters, but this is only okay for regular water—not natural mineral water.

People trusted Evian for "pure" water. Many saw this news and felt surprised or sad. They thought they were buying water from the Alps, but it was sometimes treated like tap water.

Was the Government Involved?

Yes. Reports said that French government people knew about the change. They knew since September 2021, but did not tell the public. They thought telling people might hurt the water companies or the market. Evian's company and others even offered to pay money to stop the problem from getting worse.

One politician called this situation "unacceptable." He said it was hard to understand how companies and the government might help each other hide the truth.

Court Case in the United States

In addition to problems in Europe, Danone's Evian also faced a legal fight in the United States. A group of consumers filed a lawsuit, saying that calling the water "natural" was misleading because of microplastics found in bottles. But in 2025, a federal judge dismissed the case. The judge said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows the use of the word "natural" if the water comes from a natural source, even if the purity is questioned. This means Evian could still use the "natural" label despite the controversy.

What Does This Teach Us?

1. Always check labels and news – Even trusted brands can make mistakes. Knowing more about your water helps you make smart choices.

2. Know the type of water – Natural mineral water comes from nature, with minerals. Purified water can be cleaned or changed. They are not the same.

3. Transparency matters – A good product must be honest. If companies or governments hide information, people lose trust.

What Should You Do?

- If you want true mineral water, look for clear labels and brand information.
- Follow news or reports to make sure the water you buy is what it says.
- Support clear rules and honest labeling for all water brands.

Looking Ahead

By now, people should be more careful about labels and safety. Some simple tips for buying water:

- Read the label. Look for "natural mineral water" vs. "purified water."
- Search online. Check if any news shows that a brand made a mistake.
- Ask questions. If you're unsure, ask the store worker or brand for information.

When we know what is in our water, it helps us feel safe. Water is important and we drink it every day. If the brand says "natural," we want it to mean real natural water, not water that was changed in a secret way.
