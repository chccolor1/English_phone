# THE CHOICE TO BE BETTER

Leadership is not about being in charge.  
It is about taking care of those in your charge.  
— Simon Sinek

In today’s world, work is more than just doing tasks. It is about how people connect with each other. Many experts say that leaders should bring their **best self** to work—not their whole self. This idea is becoming more important in 2025 as people look for healthy and balanced workplaces.

### What Does “Best Self” Mean?
Your best self is the part of you that shows kindness, patience, and focus. It means acting in a way that helps others trust you. Being your best self is not about being perfect. It is about being professional and positive in the workplace.

For example, if you are upset at home, it is natural to feel stressed. But if you bring all that stress to work, it may hurt your team. Instead, if you bring your best self, you can handle problems calmly and help others feel safe.

### Why Not Bring Your “Whole Self”?
Some believe that showing the whole self—including every feeling—makes them more “real.” But research shows this can create confusion and tension. Sharing everything, even negative emotions, can make others feel uncomfortable or less productive.

This does not mean hiding who you are. It means knowing when and how to share. A leader who brings their whole self without limits may appear careless. A leader who brings their best self, however, shows respect for the team.

### The Role of Balance
Work-life balance is a popular topic today. Leaders set the tone. When leaders bring their best self, they show others how to manage stress and focus on solutions.

Simple actions like listening carefully, speaking clearly, and being fair can make a big difference. In fact, a 2025 survey found that teams led by calm and positive leaders were 30% more likely to report job satisfaction.

### How Can Leaders Do This?
1. Practice self-awareness—notice how you feel before work, breathe if stressed.  
2. Set healthy limits—share enough personal details to build trust, but not too much.  
3. Focus on solutions—say “Let’s find a way to solve it” instead of focusing on problems.  
4. Be consistent—show respect and fairness daily.  

As the saying goes, “Don’t wear your heart on your sleeve.” This idiom reminds us it’s wise to manage emotions in public spaces, especially at work.
