# TEARS AT THE AIRPORT  

Wherever you go becomes a part of you somehow.  
— Anita Desai  

Many young people from China feel a special emotion after visiting Seoul in South Korea. They call it "Seoul disease". The phrase describes the sadness and longing some visitors have when they leave Seoul and return home.  

In recent years the number of Chinese tourists to South Korea has grown. Seoul offers modern subways, clean streets and vibrant culture. Social media posts show emotional moments at the airport in Incheon when travelers leave. One video on Douyin shows a young woman crying on a train to the airport. She says the tears started "uncontrollably" when she realized the trip was over.  

Tourism data show a rebound in travel from China to South Korea. A temporary visa-free entry rule for groups of three or more Chinese tourists will run from late 2025 to mid-2026. This policy is expected to increase visitor numbers.  

What causes Seoul disease? First, many visitors admire Korean pop culture, fashion and food. For some the trip feels like an escape from daily life. Second, the moment of return can trigger an emotional shock. Leaving the holiday city means returning to normal routines, and some travelers feel a gap. Third, the social media posts amplify the feeling. When travelers see similar posts online they feel less alone.  

These feelings are not necessarily negative. They often reflect deep appreciation for the experience. The term “disease” is used playfully, not medically. Still, the emotion shows how travel can reach beyond tourism and affect personal moods.  

The phenomenon raises questions for tourism businesses and city planners. For example, how can Seoul welcome more visitors while helping them transition smoothly back home? The city’s infrastructure—transport, accommodation and services—matters. Clean public transport and friendly neighborhoods help create positive memories. Research into Chinese tourists’ experiences in Seoul highlights how “urban tourism experience” involves ease of movement, comfort and friendly staff.  

Another factor is the cost and exchange rate. Studies show that when prices in South Korea rise or the Chinese yuan weakens against the won, fewer Chinese tourists arrive. The data suggest that economical travel conditions matter for sustaining visitor numbers.  

What does this mean for travellers? If someone plans a trip to Seoul they may enjoy the vibrant city and rich experiences. At the same time they may prepare for the return flight. Being aware of possible feelings of longing may help. Some travelers find it helpful to plan a gradual transition: for example, a quiet last day in the city, or sharing memories with friends after returning.  

For South Korea the tourism industry may use this emotional effect to enhance services. Friendly greeting at arrival, helpful guides and smooth transport create a stronger positive impression. On departure day the airport experience matters. Relaxed, welcoming services may reduce emotional withdrawal.  

The motif of “Seoul disease” also reflects changing travel trends. After global travel restrictions eased, more Chinese visitors returned to Seoul. The wave of tourism includes culture, beauty, food and technology. Seoul offers a mix of tradition and modernity which appeals strongly to young travelers.  

In December 2025, as travel continues to recover and evolve, the emotional dimension of tourism gains importance. Understanding how cities and travelers interact helps build better travel experiences. Seoul disease is a vivid example of how visiting a place can become emotionally meaningful.  

Travel is more than seeing new sites. It is meeting different ways of living and feeling connection. When travelers leave a place like Seoul, the memory stays. The emotion stays. It shapes future travel decisions. Cities that value this emotional side will lead in the new era of tourism.
