## WORKING IN A HOT WORLD  
*(int)*

Sunshine is delicious, rain is refreshing, wind braces us, snow is exhilarating; there is really no such thing as bad weather, only different kinds of good weather.

— John Ruskin

Today, many workers face a big problem: working in too much heat. Heat can make people sick. It can be dangerous. This article is about how to keep people safe when it is very hot at work.

**Why Heat Is a Problem**

Health experts say the heat is a serious risk for workers. Around 2.4 billion people, or 70 percent of workers in the world, feel this heat every day. Many get hurt or even die because of heat at work. Every year, there are millions of injuries and thousands of deaths from too much heat.

When it gets hotter than 20 °C (with humidity), workers do not work as fast. For each degree warmer, work slows down by about 2-3 percent. That means people are slower. They feel tired. They may make mistakes. This is not good for them or for the place where they work.

**Who Is Most in Danger?**

Some people face more danger than others. People who work outside—like gardeners, farmers, and builders—find it very hard when the sun is strong. Also, people who work near hot machines, like stoves or furnaces, feel more heat.

Other groups, such as older people, children, or people with health problems, are also more at risk. Their bodies do not cool off as well. That is why they must take care and get help when it is hot.

What Can Help?

Experts say we must act now. There are simple steps all workplaces can take:

- Use warning systems. These tell workers when it will be very hot soon.
- Give extra rest. Workers can have more breaks to cool down and drink water.
- Change clothing and spaces. Work uniforms can be lighter. Work areas can be cooler.
- Be ready for emergencies. Plans help if someone has heat stroke or feels faint.

In some countries, new rules are being made. For example, if the heat index reaches 90 °F (about 32 °C), workers get a paid 15-minute break every few hours.

Why It Matters

As our planet warms, heat is no longer short-lived. It lasts longer and comes back more often. That is a big worry. Heat is now one of the most dangerous hazards for workers. If we do not act, the situation will only get worse.

To stop the root of the problem, we must cut down the use of fossil fuels. These cause heating in our world. If we do not do this, we will always be one step behind—playing catch-up while the heat keeps rising.

In a Nutshell

- Too much heat at work is dangerous for many millions of people.
- Work slows, injuries grow, and some die when workplaces are too hot.
- Simple actions—like breaks, shade, water, and warnings—can make a big difference.
- Strong rules and a clean energy future are key to protecting workers.

We can stay safe in a hot world. With smart steps and care, we can make sure that work doesn’t turn into “too hot to handle.”
