# A SMALL PRICE FOR LESS WASTE

The greatest threat to our planet is the belief that someone else will save it.
Robert Swan

Korea is preparing a new policy to reduce plastic waste in daily life. The main focus of this plan is the use of disposable plastic cups. Starting in the near future, cafes and similar shops will no longer give these cups for free. Customers will need to pay a small fee if they choose to use a disposable plastic cup.

The government says plastic waste is a growing problem in the country. Many people buy drinks every day, and most drinks are served in plastic cups. These cups are used once and then thrown away. This creates large amounts of trash that are hard to manage. By adding a price to disposable cups, the government hopes people will think more before using them.

Under the new plan, each shop can decide the exact price of a disposable plastic cup. However, the price must stay within a set range. This range is planned to be between 100 and 200 won. This amount is small, but it is meant to reflect the cost of making the cup and to reduce waste. Customers can avoid the fee by bringing their own reusable cup or by using cups provided by the shop for reuse.

This policy is part of a larger plastic reduction plan. The government is working on rules that look at how products are made, used, and thrown away. The goal is to lower plastic use at every step. This includes product design, transport, and disposal. Companies will be encouraged to create products that use less plastic and are easier to recycle.

In the past, Korea tested a deposit system for disposable cups. In this system, customers paid extra money for a cup and got it back when they returned the cup. This system worked well in some areas, such as Jeju Island, where many cups were returned. However, many small business owners said the system was difficult to manage. Because of this, the system was not expanded nationwide.

The new policy takes a different approach. Instead of asking shops to manage returns, it focuses on reducing free use. This makes the process simpler for businesses and customers. The government believes this method can lower plastic use without placing too much pressure on small shops.

Plastic straws will still be available for customers who ask for them. The government says this change will be gradual and practical. Officials plan to listen to public opinions before finalizing the rules. A public meeting will be held so citizens and business owners can share their views.

This policy shows a shift in how Korea handles plastic waste. It encourages small changes in daily habits. Paying for disposable cups may lead more people to choose reusable options. Over time, these small actions can help reduce plastic waste across the country and support a cleaner environment.
