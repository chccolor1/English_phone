# KEEPING AI IN CHECK

In 2025, Netflix is setting clear rules for using **generative AI (GenAI)** in making shows and movies. These guidelines protect creativity, safety, and viewer trust.

### Netflix’s Five Principles
1. No copying others’ work—avoid legal and copyright issues.  
2. Don’t train on production data—protects confidentiality.  
3. Use safe systems—secure environments to prevent leaks.  
4. Keep generated content temporary—AI outputs not final unless approved.  
5. Never replace real talent without consent—actors’ voices and likenesses need permission.  

These rules were made after controversy over AI-generated images in a Netflix documentary. Some viewers felt misled, especially in true-crime stories where authenticity is critical.

### Why It Matters
- Netflix balances innovation with responsibility.  
- Example: In *The Eternaut*, AI created a building collapse scene—10x faster and cheaper than traditional effects.  
- By requiring transparency and approval, Netflix protects both its brand and creators.  

In short, Netflix views AI as a useful helper—but one that must follow strong rules to avoid harm.
