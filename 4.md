# COST OF CONFIDENCE

The government solution to a problem 
is usually as bad as the problem.

China’s economy is getting a boost from an unexpected source: shoppers. In 2025, millions of Chinese consumers are buying smartphones, refrigerators, and even electric cars, thanks to generous government subsidies. These financial incentives have helped people afford products that were once too expensive. But the big question is: what happens when the subsidies stop?

To understand the situation, we need to look at how subsidies work. A subsidy is a financial support from the government that makes products cheaper for consumers. In China, the government has been offering cash vouchers, discounts, and tax cuts to encourage people to spend more. These policies aim to improve the country’s slow-growing economy, especially after years of strict pandemic lockdowns and a struggling real estate market.

The strategy seems to be working—for now. Big brands like Apple have seen a rise in sales. Appliance makers are also enjoying a strong comeback, as many families are upgrading old air conditioners or washing machines. In short, it looks like consumers are back in the game, and the Chinese economy is starting to breathe again.

But experts warn that this boost may not last. “It’s a sugar rush,” said one economist, explaining that the short-term growth from subsidies may not lead to long-term stability. As soon as the government stops offering financial help, spending could drop quickly. People might return to saving money instead of shopping, especially if they’re worried about jobs, housing prices, or rising living costs.

Many Chinese families are still cautious. Unlike in Western countries, Chinese consumers tend to save more and borrow less. Even when the government encourages spending, many people prefer to hold onto their money in case of emergencies. That’s why economists say that real economic recovery depends not just on short-term spending, but also on stronger consumer confidence and better job security.

Another challenge is the country’s property market. For years, real estate was a major engine of China’s growth. Families invested in homes, and property developers borrowed large amounts of money to build more. But after several big companies failed to pay their debts, the housing market began to slow down. This made many people nervous about the future, and they reduced their spending on non-essentials.

The Chinese government is now trying to move away from depending too much on real estate and focus more on domestic consumption—getting people to spend on goods and services inside the country. This shift is important for building a more balanced and stable economy. But changing a whole country’s spending habits is no easy task.

So, what could help keep China’s shopping boom alive without relying on subsidies?

First, experts suggest improving wages and job opportunities, especially for young people. Youth unemployment in China remains high, and many fresh graduates struggle to find work. If people feel more secure in their jobs, they’re more likely to spend.

Second, companies need to offer better-quality products that match people’s needs. In recent years, many Chinese consumers have become more careful about what they buy. They prefer value for money, energy-saving features, and good customer service. Brands that understand this are more likely to keep customers even without government discounts.

Finally, stronger social support—like affordable healthcare, housing, and education—could also make a difference. When people don’t have to worry as much about these basic needs, they may feel freer to spend on other things.

In the end, while subsidies have helped kick-start China’s consumer spending, they are only part of the solution. As the saying goes, “You can’t dance forever on borrowed music.” If China wants its economy to grow in a healthy and lasting way, it will need deeper reforms that help build real trust in the system.

The coming months will be a test of how strong the recovery really is. Will the shopping spree continue once the discounts disappear? Or will consumers close their wallets again? One thing is clear: the future of China’s economy depends not just on how much people buy today, but on how confident they feel about tomorrow.
