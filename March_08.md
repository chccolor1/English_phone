## How Life Thinks Without a Brain  

For many years, scientists believed that thinking and problem-solving were only possible with a brain. However, new research suggests that even simple cells can process information and make decisions.  

Take the planarian, a tiny flatworm found in lakes and ponds. It has a small brain and two eyespots that give it a cartoonish look, but its most impressive ability is regeneration. If cut in half, both pieces grow into complete worms within a week. This ability led biologist Michael Levin to dig deeper into whether intelligence exists outside the brain. Levin's experiment involved training planaria to associate food with a specific environment. Some worms learned to find food in rough-textured dishes, while others learned in smooth dishes. After cutting off their heads and allowing them to regrow, he tested their memory. Surprisingly, the regenerated worms from rough dishes were quicker to seek food in similar environments, suggesting that memory was stored somewhere other than the brain.  

Further research showed that cells, not just neurons, can store and act on information. Cells communicate through electric fields, influencing how they grow and interact. This idea, known as basal cognition, challenges the belief that intelligence is limited to animals with brains.  

This concept is not just limited to worms. Plants also display intelligence. The touch-me-not plant folds its leaves when touched, but when repeatedly disturbed without harm, it learns to brush it off. Venus flytraps count the number of touches before closing to avoid wasting energy. Plants can even detect sounds, such as running water, and grow toward it. This suggests that plants process information about their environment to survive.  

Single-celled organisms also show unexpected intelligence. Slime molds, for example, can solve mazes to find food and even map out efficient paths similar to real-world transport networks. In one experiment, a slime mold recreated the Tokyo subway system by spreading through oat flakes arranged to represent city locations. Another study showed that slime molds could learn to tolerate unpleasant conditions if necessary for survival.  

This research challenges the traditional idea that memory is stored only in neurons. In one study, scientists transferred a memory from one sea slug to another by injecting RNA. This suggests that memory might be stored at a cellular level, opening up new possibilities for understanding intelligence and cognition.  

Levin’s research also has medical applications. He discovered that bioelectric signals control how cells develop into body parts. By altering these signals, he made tadpoles grow extra eyes or regenerate limbs. This could lead to new treatments for injuries, organ damage, and even cancer by reprogramming cells to work correctly.  

Artificial intelligence researchers are also keeping an eye on these discoveries. Unlike traditional AI, which is brain-focused, understanding how simple cells solve problems could lead to new, more adaptable machines.  

These findings suggest that intelligence exists throughout nature, not just in brains. From plants and worms to cells and slime molds, many living things process information, adapt, and make decisions. Recognizing this may change how we wrap our heads around life itself and how we define intelligence in the natural world.
