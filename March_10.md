# WHEN AVIATION SYSTEMS FAIL

Aviation is the branch of engineering that is least forgiving of mistakes. —Freeman Dyson

On Wednesday evening, social media site X quickly erupted with speculation about the midair collision over the Potomac River near Reagan National Airport (DCA). Among the many theories, one stood out—the claim that the Army Black Hawk helicopter deliberately targeted the Canadair Regional Jet (CRJ). Even former President Donald Trump weighed in, blaming the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and linking the incident to hiring policies he criticized. However, as is often the case with aviation accidents, the true explanation is far more complex.

While official findings from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will take about a year, early indications suggest multiple contributing factors rather than a singular cause. The NTSB adheres to the “Swiss cheese” model, which assumes accidents occur when multiple failures align rather than due to one catastrophic mistake. Investigators will examine whether standard procedures and equipment functioned correctly and whether airspace design contributed to the crash.

Preliminary data suggests key systems were operational. Aircraft in Washington’s controlled airspace transmit their identity and altitude via a transponder, allowing radar systems to track them. The available flight paths indicate these systems were working, but investigators will verify whether the helicopter accurately reported its altitude and adhered to assigned flight levels. The Black Hawk was expected to remain below the CRJ’s approach path to Runway 33.

Helicopter pilots often maneuver comfortably in tight spaces, as demonstrated in 2005 when FAA officials took journalists on a low-altitude helicopter tour of Washington, showcasing their ability to fly beneath radar coverage. However, the Black Hawk in this collision was not invisible to radar, and a key component of the system—air traffic control—seemed to function as designed. A DCA tower controller alerted the helicopter to the approaching jet twice, but its response remains a point of scrutiny.

Recordings confirm that the controller first issued a warning about 40 seconds before impact, instructing the helicopter to maintain visual separation. The crew acknowledged the traffic in sight but did not change course. A second warning to pass behind the jet received no recorded response. The crew’s use of night-vision goggles, which can restrict peripheral vision, may have impaired their ability to fully assess their surroundings.

The investigation will rely on recovered cockpit voice and flight data recorders from the CRJ to analyze what the pilots heard, said, and how their onboard collision-avoidance systems functioned. The Black Hawk’s recording devices remain undisclosed. Anti-collision systems, designed to trigger evasive maneuvers, are often disabled at low altitudes to prevent unnecessary alarms, raising questions about their role in this incident.

The FAA’s management of air traffic control staffing will also be examined. Reports indicate that only one controller was on duty instead of the usual two, but workload assessments will determine if this impacted safety. Additionally, the broader issue of FAA modernization—hampered by political resistance—could resurface in post-crash discussions.

Despite rare fatal airline crashes in the U.S., midair collisions remain a risk, particularly in congested airspace. The NTSB will issue probable cause findings but will not assign blame, focusing instead on systemic improvements to prevent future tragedies. As aviation technology and training advance, this incident will serve as another case study in enhancing flight safety.

## 01. Comprehension Questions

- What is the “Swiss cheese” model mentioned in the article, and how does it relate to the Reagan Airport collision?
- What did the tower controller do when they noticed the potential conflict between the Black Hawk and the CRJ?
- Why might the Black Hawk crew’s use of night-vision goggles have contributed to the collision?

## 02. Discussion Questions

- How can air traffic control procedures be improved to prevent midair collisions in congested airspace?
- What are the potential risks of relying on automation and anti-collision systems in modern aviation?
- Should flight training policies for military and commercial pilots differ when operating in shared civilian airspace?
